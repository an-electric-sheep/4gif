# 4gif

An optimizing video to gif converter for a certain image board

---

Goal: Squeeze maxium quality and/or resolution out of the 3MiB limit

Available resolution/compression quality tradeoffs:

* framerate decimation
* dithering/banding
* approximate color substitution (inter-frame fuzzing)
* per frame palettes/single global color palette

Additional features:

* splicing multiple timecode ranges into a single gif
* forward-rewind loops

RTFM (no, not this one, baka)
